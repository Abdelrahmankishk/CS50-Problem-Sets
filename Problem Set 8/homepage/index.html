            Introduction <span class="badge bg-secondary"></span>
        </b></h>
        <h class="text">
            <p> Mixed martial arts (MMA), sometimes referred to as cage fighting, no holds barred (NHB), and ultimate fighting, and originally referred to as Vale Tudo is a full-contact combat sport based on striking, grappling and ground fighting, incorporating techniques from various combat sports from around the world. The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993. The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate</p>
            <hr>
            <p>In the 1990s, the Gracie family brought their Brazilian jiu-jitsu style, first developed in Brazil from the 1920s, to the United States  which culminated in the founding of <a href="https://www.ufc.com/"> The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)</a>  promotion company in 1993. The company held an event with almost no rules, mostly due to the influence of Art Davie and Rorion Gracie attempting to replicate Vale Tudo fights that existed in Brazil and would later implement a different set of rules (example: eliminating kicking a grounded opponent), which differed from other leagues which were more in favour of realistic, street like fights</p>
        </h>
        <h class="bold"><i> Rules <span class="badge bg-secondary"></span></i></h>
        <h class="text">
        <p>The rules for modern mixed martial arts competitions have changed significantly since the early days of vale tudo, Japanese shoot wrestling, and UFC 1, and even more from the historic style of pankration. As the knowledge of fighting techniques spread among fighters and spectators, it became clear that the original minimalist rule systems needed to be amended. The main motivations for these rule changes were protection of the health of the fighters, the desire to shed the perception of "barbarism and lawlessness", and to be recognized as a legitimate sport.</p>
        <p>The new rules included the introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts_weight_classes">weight classes</a> ; as knowledge about submissions spread, differences in weight had become a significant factor. There are nine different weight classes in the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. These nine weight classes include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight#Mixed_Martial_Arts"> flyweight (up to 125 lb / 56.7 kg)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight_(MMA)">bantamweight (up to 135 lb / 61.2 kg)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight_(MMA)">featherweight (up to 145 lb / 65.8 kg)</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_(MMA)"> lightweight (up to 155 lb / 70.3 kg)</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight_(MMA)"> welterweight (up to 170 lb / 77.1 kg)</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight_(MMA)"> middleweight (up to 185 lb / 83.9 kg)</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight_(MMA)"> light heavyweight (up to 205 lb / 93.0 kg)</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight_(MMA)"> heavyweight (up to 265 lb / 120.2 kg)</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_heavyweight_(MMA)"> super heavyweight with no upper weight limit</a>.</p>
        <p>Small, open-fingered gloves were introduced to protect fists, reduce the occurrence of cuts (and stoppages due to cuts) and encourage fighters to use their hands for striking to allow more captivating matches. Gloves were first made mandatory in Japan's Shooto promotion and were later adopted by the UFC as it developed into a regulated sport. Most professional fights have the fighters wear 4 oz gloves, whereas some jurisdictions require amateurs to wear a slightly heavier 6 oz glove for more protection for the hands and wrists.</p>
        <p><b class= "bold">Time limits</b> were established to avoid long fights with little action where competitors conserved their strength. Matches without time limits also complicated the airing of live events. The time limits in most professional fights are<i> three 5 minute rounds</i>, and <b>championship fights</b><i> are normally five 5-minute rounds</i>. Similar motivations produced the "stand up" rule, where the referee can stand fighters up if it is perceived that both are resting on the ground or not advancing toward a dominant position.</p>
